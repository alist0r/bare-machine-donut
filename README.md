# bare-machine-donut
This project is ment to be a learning expirence for myself as an introduction
to bare machine programing. In this project I use nasm and c to create a simple
3d torus out of points in space, this is not ment to be a 3d renderer project
(although that is something i would like to work on in the future) but more so
and introduction for myself to the steps it takes to enter 32bit protected mode
in x86 and then execute 32 bit c code.
